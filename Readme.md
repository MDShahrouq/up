Up deploys nearly infinitely scalable serverless apps, APIs, and static websites in seconds, abstracts away complex AWS infrastructure so you can get back to writing code, all while providing cost effective, scalable, and global services. Utilizing AWS Lambda and API Gateway you pay only for what you use, all securely in your own AWS infrastructure. In the future additional providers may be supported.

Up currently supports Node.js, Golang, Python, Crystal, and static sites out of the box. Once deployed you're ready to go! No waiting on remote builds, your project is immediately available.

<details>
  <summary>Why are you charging money for a Pro version?</summary>
  I am an independent developer, with no funding, so it is the only way I can support myself and the project! Commercial support, additional features, bug fix, and feature priority are provided with the Pro license, ensuring the project stays alive.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How is this different than apex(1) or Serverless?</summary>
  Most of the AWS Lambda based tools are function-oriented, while Up abstracts this away entirely. Up does not use framework "shims", the servers that you run using Up are regular HTTP servers and require no code changes for Lambda compatibility.

  <summary>How much does it cost to run an application?</summary>
  AWS API Gateway provides 1 million free requests per month, so there's a good chance you won't have to pay anything at all!
